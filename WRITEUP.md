# Write-up for CMS system 

### Solution and resource analysis.

*We are going to use App services insted of VM because of these reasons:*
- *App services will provide us with High availability and vertical scalability for our small application.* 
- *App services it will help to start quickly and deploy our app faster, and this what we need in a new web app.* 
- *Our CMS currently is a lightweight and does not contains to many proceeses and requests and it can be satisfied by App services*
- *Choosing App services will help us to save cost, becuase VM are more expensive*

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*However, In future our app could get bigger and we might need to use and develop more services to enahnce our CMS website.* 
*So we could change our cloud computing plan to VM to meet our needs and satisfy the different requierments of our CMS system such as more CPU, RAM and storage*
